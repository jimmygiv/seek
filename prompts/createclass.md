# Class Creation
This is kind of a follow-on of [CLI Arguments](cliarguments.md). I just had it kind of expand the validation logic to the python class. I had to do some refactoring, but this was almost exactly as needed. I've added kwargs just to pass regex options.

## Create Class
#### Question:
```
Write a class called "Seek" with a __init__ that handles **kwargs (key word arguments). I want the keyword arguments to be called filename, string, regex, and hexstring. I want each to be validated with the corresponding validate_ functions in the code above.
```

### Response:
Sure, here is an example of how you can create a class called "Seek" that handles keyword arguments and validates them using the validate functions from the previous example:
```python
import os
import argparse

class Seek:
    def __init__(self, **kwargs):
        self.filename = kwargs.get('filename', None)
        self.string = kwargs.get('string', None)
        self.regex = kwargs.get('regex', None)
        self.hexstring = kwargs.get('hexstring', None)
        
        self.validate_file(self.filename)
        self.validate_string(self.string)
        self.validate_regex(self.regex)
        self.validate_hex(self.hexstring)

    def validate_file(self, value):
        if not os.path.isfile(value):
            raise argparse.ArgumentTypeError("Invalid file")
        if not os.access(value, os.R_OK):
            raise argparse.ArgumentTypeError("File is not readable")
        return value

    def validate_string(self, value):
        if not isinstance(value, str):
            raise argparse.ArgumentTypeError("Invalid string")
        return value

    def validate_regex(self, value):
        if value is not None:
            try:
                re.compile(value)
            except re.error:
                raise argparse.ArgumentTypeError("Invalid regular expression")
        return value
    
    def validate_hex(self, value):
        if value is not None:
            try:
                bytes.fromhex(value)
            except ValueError:
                raise argparse.ArgumentTypeError("Invalid hex string")
        return value

# Example usage
seek = Seek(filename='input.txt', string='search_string', regex='.*', hexstring='deadbeef')
```

This class uses the __init__ function to initialize the class and receive keyword arguments for filename, string, regex, and hexstring. In the __init__ function, it assigns the values of the keyword arguments to the corresponding class variables, and then it uses the validate functions to check if the values are valid.
If any of the validate functions raise an exception, the class will not be created and the script will exit.

You can then use this class in other parts of your script, for example, you can use the class variables to search the file for the specified string, regex, and hexstring.
You can also add other methods to the class to perform more complex operations on the file using these arguments, like search for the hex and regex pattern in the file, or count the number of occurrences of the string.

## Find Depth

### Question:
```
I want to make a script to search for finding a hex pattern in a file and determining its min and max depth offset. Can you write something like this?
```

### Response:
Sure, here's an example of a Python script that searches for a hex pattern in a file and determines its minimum and maximum depth offset:

```python
import re

def hex_search(file, pattern):
    min_offset = None
    max_offset = None
    with open(file, 'rb') as f:
        data = f.read()
        for match in re.finditer(pattern, data):
            offset = match.start()
            if min_offset is None or offset < min_offset:
                min_offset = offset
            if max_offset is None or offset > max_offset:
                max_offset = offset
    return min_offset, max_offset

# Example usage
file = 'path/to/file'
pattern = b'[0-9a-fA-F]{32}'  # Example hex pattern
min_offset, max_offset = hex_search(file, pattern)
print(f'Minimum offset: {min_offset}')
print(f'Maximum offset: {max_offset}')
```

This script uses the re library to search for the hex pattern in the file using a regular expression. The regular expression [0-9a-fA-F]{32} is used to match any 32-character string consisting of hexadecimal digits.
The script opens the file in binary mode using the 'rb' flag and reads the content of the file into memory. Then it uses the re.finditer() method to search the data for matches to the pattern. It iterates through the matches, keeping track of the minimum and maximum offset of the pattern in the file.
Finally, it returns the minimum and maximum offsets.

You can adjust the pattern, to match the specific hex pattern you are searching for.
Please note that this script will search for the hex pattern in the whole file, if you want to search in specific section of the file, you can use the data[start:end] to slice the file to the specific section you want to search in.


## Refine Depth Intent

### Question:
```
I will call this function hex_search. Could I put this into a python class so others may import the results?
```

### Response:
Yes, you can put the hex_search function into a Python class so that others can import and use the results. Here's an example of how you can do that:

```python
import re

class HexSearcher:
    def __init__(self, file):
        self.file = file

    def search(self, pattern):
        offsets = []
        with open(self.file, 'rb') as f:
            data = f.read()
            for match in re.finditer(pattern, data):
                offset = match.start()
                offsets.append(offset)
        return offsets

# Example usage
searcher = HexSearcher('path/to/file')
pattern = b'[0-9a-fA-F]{32}' # Example hex pattern
offsets = searcher.search(pattern)
print(f'Offsets: {offsets}')

```

This script will create a class called HexSearcher that takes a file path as an argument when it is instantiated.
The class has a method called search() that takes a pattern as an argument and returns a list of offsets where the hex pattern is found in the file.
By creating a class, you can create an instance of the class and use it to search multiple files for the same pattern, you can also add more methods to the class to make it more versatile.

You can use this class in other scripts by importing it and instantiating it with the file you want to search.
For example, in another script, you can do this:

```python
from HexSearcher import HexSearcher

searcher = HexSearcher("path/to/file")
pattern = b'[0-9a-fA-F]{32}'
offsets = searcher.search(pattern)
```

By packaging the function in a class, you make it more reusable and readable.
It also makes it easier to add other functionality, and it also makes it more testable.
